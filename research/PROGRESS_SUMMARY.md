# KODEON Development Progress Summary

This document summarizes the progress made in developing the KODEON programming language based on the 24-month master plan.

## Current Status

As of August 24, 2025, we have completed Phase 0 of the KODEON development, which involves project setup and initial planning.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Structure

- Created the main project directory structure:
  - `docs/` - Documentation files
  - `src/` - Main source code (to be populated)
  - `compiler/` - Compiler implementation
  - `runtime/` - Runtime engine (planned)
  - `stdlib/` - Standard library (planned)
  - `ide/` - Integrated Development Environment
  - `examples/` - Sample code
  - `tests/` - Test files

### 2. Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation plan
- Developed detailed syntax specification
- Created implementation approach document
- Wrote getting started guide
- Developed language reference guide

### 3. Compiler Development

- Designed lexer for tokenizing KODEON source code
- Implemented parser for generating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Created basic compiler structure with Rust/Cargo
- Defined token types for both Indonesian and English keywords
- Implemented basic error handling

### 4. IDE Development

- Created basic Electron-based IDE structure
- Implemented Monaco Editor integration
- Designed UI with toolbar and output panel
- Created basic language support for syntax highlighting

### 5. Examples

- Created Hello World example in both Indonesian and English
- Developed calculator example showing classes and control structures

## Next Steps (Phase 1: Foundation - Months 1-6)

### Weeks 1-4: Grammar and Syntax Design

- Finalize lexical analysis rules
- Complete grammar specification
- Create syntax validation tests

### Weeks 5-8: Lexer and Parser Implementation

- Complete lexer implementation
- Enhance parser with full AST generation
- Implement error recovery mechanisms

### Weeks 9-12: Basic Compiler Engine

- Design intermediate representation
- Implement code generation
- Create optimization passes

### Weeks 13-16: Fundamental Standard Library

- Implement core data types
- Create basic I/O operations
- Develop collection types

### Weeks 17-20: Memory Management System

- Design garbage collection approach
- Implement memory allocation
- Create profiling tools

### Weeks 21-24: Error Handling and Debugging

- Implement comprehensive error reporting
- Create debugging information generation
- Build basic debugger

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Compiler

- Primary language: Rust (for performance and memory safety)
- Parser: Custom implementation for flexibility
- Backend: LLVM (planned) for code optimization and cross-compilation

### IDE

- Electron-based for cross-platform support
- Monaco Editor for code editing capabilities
- VS Code extensions for language features

### Package Management

- Custom registry with global CDN (planned)
- Semantic versioning and dependency resolution

## Prerequisites for Next Phase

1. Install Rust and Cargo toolchain
2. Set up LLVM development environment
3. Configure Electron development environment
4. Establish CI/CD pipeline
5. Create GitHub repository for version control

## Team Structure Recommendation

Based on the implementation approach document, the following team structure is recommended for Phase 1:

1. **Language Design Team** (2-3 people)

   - Language Designer
   - Compiler Engineer
   - Runtime Engineer

2. **Tooling Team** (2 people)

   - IDE Developer
   - Parser/Lexer Specialist

3. **Documentation Team** (1 person)
   - Technical Writer

## Timeline

With the current progress, we are well-positioned to begin Phase 1 implementation immediately upon securing the necessary development resources and environment setup.

## Conclusion

The foundational planning and initial structure for the KODEON programming language have been successfully established. The next step is to implement the core language features according to the 24-month roadmap, starting with the lexer, parser, and basic compiler engine.
