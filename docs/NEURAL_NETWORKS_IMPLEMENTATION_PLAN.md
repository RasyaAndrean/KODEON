3. **Automated Model Optimization**: Implement automatic optimization techniques
4. **Distributed Training Capabilities**: Support training on multiple devices/nodes
5. **Model Deployment and Serving**: Enable easy deployment of trained models

## Technical Architecture

### Language Extensions

#### Neural Network Keywords and Syntax

New keywords will be added to the KODEON language to support neural networks:

-   `jaringan` / `network`: Define neural network models
-   `lapisan` / `layer`: Define neural network layers
-   `tensor`: Multi-dimensional array for data
-   `model`: Machine learning model
-   `latih` / `train`: Train a model
-   `prediksi` / `predict`: Make predictions with a model
-   `optimisasi` / `optimize`: Optimize model parameters
-   `fungsi_hilang` / `loss_function`: Define loss functions
-   `gradien` / `gradient`: Compute gradients

#### Example Syntax

```kodeon
// Create a simple neural network
jaringan myNetwork = jaringan()

// Add layers
myNetwork.tambah_lapisan(lapisan.input(784))
myNetwork.tambah_lapisan(lapisan.tersembunyi(128, aktivasi="relu"))
myNetwork.tambah_lapisan(lapisan.keluaran(10, aktivasi="softmax"))

// Define loss function and optimizer
fungsi_hilang loss = fungsi_hilang.kategorikal_silang_entropi()
optimisasi optimizer = optimisasi.adam(kecepatan_belajar=0.001)

// Train the model
myNetwork.latih(data_latih, label_latih, epochs=10, batch_size=32, loss=loss, optimizer=optimizer)

// Make predictions
prediksi hasil = myNetwork.prediksi(data_uji)
