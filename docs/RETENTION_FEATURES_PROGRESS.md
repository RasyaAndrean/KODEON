## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Environment Setup

**Challenge**: Rust/Cargo environment not available for testing
**Solution**: Focus on implementation and planning, defer testing until environment is available

### 2. Multi-language Support

**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent error messages in both Indonesian and English
**Solution**: Created structured error message database with language-specific content

### 3. Integration Complexity

**Challenge**: Coordinating changes across multiple compiler components
**Solution**: Modular approach with clear interfaces between components

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

-   2 Compiler Engineers (error handling, debugging)
-   1 UX Designer (error message design)
-   1 QA Engineer (testing error handling)
-   1 Technical Writer (documentation, examples)

### Tools and Technologies
