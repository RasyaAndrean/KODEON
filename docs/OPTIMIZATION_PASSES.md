# Optimization Passes in KODEON

## Overview

This document describes the optimization passes implementation in the KODEON compiler. Optimization passes improve the performance and efficiency of compiled KODEON programs by transforming the Intermediate Representation (IR) to eliminate redundant computations, reduce code size, and improve execution speed.

## Features

### Constant Folding

Constant folding evaluates constant expressions at compile time rather than runtime. This optimization:

1. **Reduces Runtime Computations** - Pre-calculates expressions with known values
2. **Improves Performance** - Eliminates unnecessary calculations during program execution
3. **Reduces Code Size** - Replaces expressions with their computed values

Supported constant operations:

-   Integer arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
-   Float arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
-   Boolean operations (and, or, not)
-   Unary operations (negation)

### Dead Code Elimination

Dead code elimination removes unused instructions and values from the IR:

1. **Removes Unused Computations** - Eliminates calculations whose results are never used
2. **Reduces Memory Usage** - Removes unnecessary variable allocations
3. **Improves Cache Performance** - Smaller code size leads to better cache utilization

### LLVM Backend Optimizations

The LLVM backend integrates with LLVM's powerful optimization infrastructure:

1. **Industry-Standard Optimizations** - Access to proven optimization passes
2. **Target-Specific Optimizations** - Platform-specific performance improvements
3. **Advanced Optimizations** - Sophisticated transformations like inlining, loop optimizations, and SSA-based optimizations

## Implementation Details

### Optimization Pass Trait

The compiler uses a trait-based approach for optimization passes:

```rust
/// Optimization pass trait
pub trait OptimizationPass {
    /// Run the optimization pass on an IR module
    fn run(&self, module: &mut IRModule) -> Result<(), String>;

    /// Get the name of the optimization pass
    fn name(&self) -> &str;
}
```

### Constant Folding Implementation

The constant folding pass analyzes binary and unary operations to determine if they can be evaluated at compile time:

```rust
impl ConstantFolding {
    /// Try to fold an instruction into a constant value
    fn try_fold_instruction(&self, instruction: &Instruction) -> Option<Value> {
        match instruction {
            Instruction::BinaryOp { op, left, right, .. } => {
                // Check if both operands are constants
                if let (Value::Constant(left_const), Value::Constant(right_const)) = (left, right) {
                    // Perform the operation based on the operator and operand types
                    // ...
                }
                None
            }
            // Handle unary operations similarly
            _ => None
        }
    }
}
```

### Dead Code Elimination Implementation

The dead code elimination pass identifies and removes unused instructions:

```rust
impl OptimizationPass for DeadCodeElimination {
    fn run(&self, module: &mut IRModule) -> Result<(), String> {
        // Track which values are actually used
        // Remove instructions that produce unused values
        // ...
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Optimizer Orchestrator

The optimizer orchestrates multiple optimization passes:

```rust
/// Optimizer that runs multiple optimization passes
pub struct Optimizer {
    passes: Vec<Box<dyn OptimizationPass>>,
}

impl Optimizer {
    /// Create a new optimizer
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Optimizer {
            passes: vec![
                Box::new(ConstantFolding),
                Box::new(DeadCodeElimination),
            ],
        }
    }

    /// Run all optimization passes on an IR module
    pub fn optimize(&self, module: &mut IRModule) -> Result<(), String> {
        for pass in &self.passes {
            println!("Running optimization pass: {}", pass.name());
            pass.run(module)?;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Compiler Integration

The optimization passes are automatically applied during the compilation process:

1. **IR Generation** - The compiler generates unoptimized IR from the AST
2. **Optimization** - The optimizer applies passes to the IR
3. **Code Generation** - The optimized IR is converted to target code

### Command-Line Options

The compiler provides options to control optimization:

```bash
# Compile with optimizations (default)
kompiler program.kodeon

# Compile with verbose output to see optimization passes
kompiler program.kodeon --verbose
```

## Supported Optimizations

### Current Optimizations

1. **Constant Folding** - Evaluates constant expressions at compile time
2. **Dead Code Elimination** - Removes unused instructions and values

### Future Optimizations

1. **Function Inlining** - Replaces function calls with function bodies
2. **Loop Optimizations** - Loop unrolling, invariant code motion, etc.
3. **Register Allocation** - Efficient use of CPU registers
4. **Advanced SSA Optimizations** - Global value numbering, sparse conditional constant propagation

## Example

See [optimization_demo.kodeon](../examples/optimization_demo.kodeon) for a sample program that demonstrates optimization passes.

## Testing

The optimization support includes comprehensive tests:

1. **Constant Folding Tests** - Verify constant expression evaluation
2. **Dead Code Elimination Tests** - Test removal of unused code
3. **Integration Tests** - Verify optimization passes work together
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - Measure optimization effectiveness

## Conclusion

The optimization passes implementation provides KODEON programs with performance improvements while maintaining the language's simplicity and ease of use. The modular design allows for easy addition of new optimization passes and integration with industry-standard optimization frameworks like LLVM.
