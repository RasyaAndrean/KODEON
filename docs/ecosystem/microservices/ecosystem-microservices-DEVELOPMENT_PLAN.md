# Microservices Development Plan

## Overview

The Microservices module will enable KODEON developers to build, deploy, and manage microservice architectures with minimal configuration.

## Goals

1. Simplified microservice development
2. Service discovery and communication
3. Load balancing and fault tolerance
4. Distributed tracing and monitoring
5. Container orchestration integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework

- Service definition and registration
- HTTP/REST communication
- Basic load balancing
- Health checks and monitoring

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- Message queue integration
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Service mesh integration
- Configuration management

### Phase 3: Production Features

- Auto-scaling capabilities
- Advanced security features
- Multi-cloud deployment
- Performance optimization

## Technical Requirements

- Integration with container technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Service mesh support (Istio, Linkerd)
- Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
- Monitoring and tracing (Prometheus, Jaeger)

## Dependencies

- Working KODEON compiler
- Standard library implementation
- Networking modules
- Cloud platform integration
