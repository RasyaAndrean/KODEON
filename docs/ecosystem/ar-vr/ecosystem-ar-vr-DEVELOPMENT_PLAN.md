# AR/VR Development Plan

## Overview

The AR/VR module will enable KODEON developers to create augmented and virtual reality applications using the familiar KODEON syntax.

## Goals

1. AR/VR application development framework
2. 3D graphics rendering capabilities
3. Spatial computing integration
4. Cross-platform AR/VR support
5. Intuitive 3D programming interface

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework

- 3D graphics rendering engine integration
- Basic 3D object manipulation
- Camera and sensor access
- Simple AR marker detection

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- Physics engine integration
- Spatial audio support
- Gesture recognition
- Multi-user AR/VR experiences

### Phase 3: Platform Support

- Mobile AR (ARKit, ARCore)
- VR headset support (Oculus, HTC Vive)
- Web-based AR/VR
- Desktop AR/VR applications

## Technical Requirements

- Integration with existing 3D libraries (Three.js, Unity, Unreal)
- WebGL/WebXR support for web deployment
- Native performance optimization
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Dependencies

- Working KODEON compiler
- Standard library implementation
- Graphics and mathematics modules
