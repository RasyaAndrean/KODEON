## Overview

The KODEON ecosystem provides a complete development environment that extends beyond the core language to support various application domains and development workflows.

Each component directory follows the standard KODEON organization pattern with:

-   README.md - Explains the purpose, contents, and usage
-   DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - Outlines current status, upcoming features, and roadmap

## Contributing

To contribute to any ecosystem component:

1. Review the component's README.md and DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md
