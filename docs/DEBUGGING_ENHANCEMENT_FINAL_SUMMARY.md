## Technical Implementation Details

### Enhanced DebugInfo Structure

The DebugInfo structure in `ir.rs` was enhanced to include additional context information:

```rust
/// Enhanced debug information for source code locations
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct DebugInfo {
    pub file_name: String,
    pub line: usize,
    pub column: usize,
    pub scope: Option<String>,        // Variable scope information
    pub function: Option<String>,     // Function name
    pub module: Option<String>,       // Module name
    pub timestamp: std::time::SystemTime, // When this debug info was created
}
```

### LLVM Backend Improvements

The LLVM backend was enhanced to generate more detailed debug information:

1. Function-level debug information with scope, function, and module context
