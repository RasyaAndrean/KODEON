# Extended LLVM Backend Features in KODEON

This document describes the extended features implemented in the KODEON LLVM backend to support multi-language constructs.

## Go-Style Concurrency Support

The LLVM backend now supports Go-style concurrency features:

### Channels

- Channels are implemented as LLVM structs with buffer, size, count, and mutex fields
- `MakeChannel` instruction creates a new channel with specified element type
- `ChannelSend` and `ChannelReceive` instructions handle communication
- Runtime functions are generated for channel operations

### Goroutines

- `GoRoutine` instruction creates new execution contexts
- `Select` instruction monitors multiple channels for readiness
- `Defer` instruction registers cleanup functions

## Rust-Style Features

### Traits

- Trait types are represented as pointers to vtables
- `TraitMethodCall` instruction handles dynamic dispatch
- `Match` instruction provides pattern matching capabilities

## Kotlin-Style Null Safety

### Nullable Types

- Nullable types are implemented as optionals (struct with flag and value)
- `NullCheck` instruction checks if a value is null
- `Elvis` operator (null coalescing) provides default values

## C#-Style LINQ

### Query Operations

- `LinqQuery` instruction represents LINQ operations
- Method chaining is supported for functional transformations

## PHP-Style Features

### Superglobals

- `SuperglobalAccess` instruction provides access to global variables

## Ruby-Style Features

### Blocks

- `BlockCall` instruction handles block execution with closures

## SQL-Style Features

### Queries

- `SqlQuery` instruction represents database queries

## R-Style Statistical Computing

### Functions

- `StatisticalFunction` instruction calls statistical functions

## Implementation Details

### Type System Extensions

The LLVM backend now supports all extended IR types:

- `Channel` and `Goroutine` for Go-style concurrency
- `Trait` for Rust-style traits
- `Nullable` for Kotlin-style null safety
- `Table` and `DataFrame` for SQL/R-style data structures
- `Vector` for R-style vectors

### Value Representation

Extended IR values are properly converted to LLVM representations:

- Complex structs for channels and optionals
- Pointers for objects, traits, and data structures
- Special handling for nullable and optional types

### Runtime Support

The backend generates calls to runtime functions for complex operations:

- Channel operations (`channel_send`, `channel_receive`)
- Goroutine management (`go_routine`)
- Deferred execution (`defer_call`)

## Usage Examples

### Go-Style Channels

```kodeon
fungsi contoh_kanal() {
    buat c = kanal(int)
    pergi fungsi() { c <- 42 }()
    buat hasil = <-c
}
```

### Kotlin-Style Null Safety

```kodeon
fungsi contoh_null_safety() {
    buat nama? = "Budi"
    buat umur? = null
    buat nama_tampil = nama ?: "Anonim"
}
```

## Future Improvements

1. Full runtime implementation for concurrency primitives
2. Optimization passes for extended constructs
3. Better error handling and debugging support
4. Integration with external libraries for database and statistical functions
