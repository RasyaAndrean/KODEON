# KODEON Concurrency Features

KODEON provides advanced concurrency features inspired by various programming languages, making it easy to write concurrent and parallel programs.

## Mutexes

Mutexes (mutual exclusion locks) are used to protect shared data from being accessed by multiple goroutines simultaneously.

### Creating a Mutex

```kodeon
var mutex = create_mutex()
```

### Locking and Unlocking

```kodeon
lock_mutex(mutex)   // Acquire the lock
// Critical section
unlock_mutex(mutex) // Release the lock
```

## Condition Variables

Condition variables are used for coordinating between goroutines, allowing them to wait for specific conditions to be met.

### Creating a Condition Variable

```kodeon
var condition = create_condition()
```

### Waiting and Signaling

```kodeon
wait_condition(condition, mutex)    // Wait for a signal
signal_condition(condition)         // Wake up one waiting goroutine
broadcast_condition(condition)      // Wake up all waiting goroutines
```

## Atomic Operations

Atomic operations provide lock-free synchronization for simple data types, offering better performance for certain use cases.

### Atomic Load and Store

```kodeon
var address = create_address(0)
var value = atomic_load(address)    // Atomically load a value
atomic_store(address, 42)           // Atomically store a value
```

### Atomic Exchange

```kodeon
var old = atomic_exchange(address, 100)  // Atomically replace a value
```

### Atomic Compare and Exchange

```kodeon
var result = atomic_compare_exchange(address, expected, new_value)
```

### Atomic Fetch Operations

```kodeon
var add = atomic_fetch_add(address, increment)  // Add and return old value
var sub = atomic_fetch_sub(address, decrement)  // Subtract and return old value
```

## Goroutines

Goroutines are lightweight threads that enable concurrent execution.

```kodeon
go {
    // Concurrent code
}
```

## Example: Thread-Safe Counter

```kodeon
class Counter {
    var value: int
    var mutex: mutex

    function new() {
        value = 0
    }

    function increment() {
        lock_mutex(mutex)
        value = value + 1
        unlock_mutex(mutex)
    }

    function get(): int {
        lock_mutex(mutex)
        var result = value
        unlock_mutex(mutex)
        return result
    }
}
```

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation of concurrency features in the KODEON compiler generates placeholder calls to runtime functions. A full implementation would require:

1. A runtime library providing implementations of mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations
2. Proper integration with the target platform's threading system
3. Memory management for concurrent data structures
4. Error handling for concurrency-related operations

For LLVM targets, the compiler generates calls to functions like `mutex_lock`, `condition_wait`, etc., which would need to be provided by a runtime library.

For transpiled targets (JavaScript, Python), concurrency features are currently implemented as placeholders, as true concurrency requires runtime support that is not yet implemented in the transpilers.
