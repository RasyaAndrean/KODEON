# Parser Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the KODEON parser, which is responsible for converting tokenized source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that can be processed by subsequent compilation phases.

## Current State

The current parser implementation in [parser.rs](src/parser.rs) provides basic parsing capabilities for core language constructs including:
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Function definitions and calls
- Control structures (if/else, while, for loops)
- Expressions and operators
- Basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans)

## Goals

1. Enhance parser to support advanced language features
2. Improve error reporting and recovery
3. Optimize parsing performance
4. Ensure compatibility with bilingual syntax (English/Indonesian)
5. Support for domain-specific language extensions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Error Handling Enhancement

#### Objectives
- Implement detailed error reporting with context
- Add error recovery mechanisms
- Provide human-readable error messages
- Include line and column information

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add position tracking to all AST nodes
- [ ] Implement error recovery for common syntax errors
- [ ] Create comprehensive error message system
- [ ] Add suggestions for common mistakes

#### Timeline
2 weeks

### Phase 2: Advanced Language Features

#### Objectives
- Support for pattern matching (when/switch statements)
- Enhanced function features (default parameters, variadic functions)
- Object-oriented programming constructs (classes, inheritance)
- Advanced data structures (arrays, maps, sets)

#### Tasks
- [ ] Implement pattern matching parsing
- [ ] Add class and inheritance syntax parsing
- [ ] Support for array and map literals
- [ ] Implement list comprehension syntax
- [ ] Add async/await syntax parsing

#### Timeline
4 weeks

### Phase 3: Performance Optimization

#### Objectives
- Improve parsing speed
- Reduce memory usage
- Optimize for large codebases
- Implement incremental parsing

#### Tasks
- [ ] Profile current parser performance
- [ ] Optimize critical parsing paths
- [ ] Implement caching for repeated parsing
- [ ] Add parallel parsing capabilities

#### Timeline
3 weeks

### Phase 4: Domain-Specific Extensions

#### Objectives
- Support for web development syntax
- Data science and AI syntax extensions
- Game development constructs
- IoT and embedded system features

#### Tasks
- [ ] Add HTML/CSS integration syntax
- [ ] Implement data science syntax (data frames, vectors)
- [ ] Add game development constructs (scenes, sprites)
- [ ] Support for IoT syntax (sensors, actuators)

#### Timeline
4 weeks

## Technical Requirements

### Parser Architecture
- Pratt parsing for expression precedence
- Recursive descent parsing for statements
- Modular design for easy extension
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Error Handling
- Detailed position tracking
- Context-aware error messages
- Recovery from common syntax errors
- Integration with IDE error reporting

### Performance
- Linear time complexity
- Minimal memory allocation
- Efficient token lookahead
- Caching for repeated operations

## Dependencies

- Lexer implementation in [lexer.rs](src/lexer.rs)
- Token definitions and position tracking
- AST node definitions in [parser.rs](src/parser.rs)
- Error handling infrastructure

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual parsing functions
- Error condition handling
- Edge case scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

### Integration Tests
- Complete program parsing
- Multi-file projects
- Language feature combinations
- Error recovery scenarios

### Validation
- Parse existing KODEON codebase
- Compare with reference implementations
- Validate AST structure correctness
- Performance regression testing

## Success Metrics

### Quality Metrics
- 95%+ test coverage
- <100ms parsing time for 1000 LOC
- Clear error messages for 90%+ syntax errors
- Recovery from 80%+ common syntax errors

### Performance Metrics
- Parsing speed improvement >20%
- Memory usage reduction >15%
- Error reporting time <10ms
- Incremental parsing support

## Future Considerations

### Language Evolution
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Deprecation warning system
- Migration tool development
- Version-specific parsing modes

### Tooling Integration
- IDE integration for real-time parsing
- Debugging support for parser internals
- Visualization of AST structures
- Performance profiling tools

This implementation plan will guide the enhancement of the KODEON parser to support advanced language features while maintaining performance and usability.
