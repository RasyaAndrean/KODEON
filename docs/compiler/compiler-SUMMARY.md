# KODEON Compiler Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of features in the KODEON programming language compiler. The work includes extending the Intermediate Representation (IR), LLVM backend, and enhancing error handling with position tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Intermediate Representation (IR) Extensions

The IR has been extended with new types, values, and instructions to support advanced concurrency:

#### New Types

-   `Mutex`: Represents a mutual exclusion lock
-   `Condition`: Represents a condition variable

#### New Values

-   `MutexValue`: Represents a mutex instance
-   `ConditionValue`: Represents a condition variable instance

#### New Instructions

-   `MutexLock`: Acquires a mutex lock
-   `MutexUnlock`: Releases a mutex lock
-   `ConditionWait`: Waits on a condition variable
-   `ConditionSignal`: Signals a condition variable
-   `ConditionBroadcast`: Broadcasts to all waiting threads on a condition variable
-   `AtomicLoad`: Atomically loads a value from memory
-   `AtomicStore`: Atomically stores a value to memory
-   `AtomicExchange`: Atomically exchanges a value in memory
-   `AtomicCompareExchange`: Atomically compares and exchanges a value in memory
-   `AtomicFetchAdd`: Atomically adds a value to memory and returns the old value
-   `AtomicFetchSub`: Atomically subtracts a value from memory and returns the old value

### 2. LLVM Backend Implementation

The LLVM backend has been enhanced to generate appropriate LLVM IR for the new concurrency instructions:

-   Mutex operations generate calls to runtime functions like `mutex_lock` and `mutex_unlock`
-   Condition variable operations generate calls to runtime functions like `condition_wait`, `condition_signal`, and `condition_broadcast`
-   Atomic operations use LLVM's built-in atomic instructions with proper ordering semantics
-   New type conversions for mutex and condition variable types

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

The compiler now provides enhanced error handling with precise position tracking:

#### Lexer Position Tracking

-   Tracks line, column, and character offset for each token
-   Provides accurate location information for error reporting
-   Supports multi-line source code with proper line counting

#### Parser Error Reporting

-   Context-aware error messages with precise location information
-   Detailed error messages for unexpected tokens and syntax errors
-   Clear indication of expected vs. found elements

#### Semantic Analysis Errors

-   Undeclared variable detection with exact location
-   Duplicate declaration detection with both declaration locations
-   Type mismatch errors with expected and found types
-   Uninitialized variable usage detection

### 4. Test Cases

Comprehensive test cases have been created to verify the implementation:

-   Unit tests for mutex instructions
-   Unit tests for condition variable instructions
-   Unit tests for atomic operations
-   Integration tests for complex concurrency scenarios
-   Error handling and position tracking tests

### 5. Example Programs

Example programs demonstrating the usage of the new features have been created:

-   A thread-safe counter using mutexes
-   Coordination between goroutines using condition variables
-   Lock-free operations using atomic operations
-   Programs demonstrating enhanced error handling

## Implementation Details

### Atomic Ordering Conversion

A helper function was added to convert KODEON's atomic ordering enums to LLVM's atomic ordering values:

-   `Relaxed` → `Monotonic`
-   `Consume` → `Acquire`
-   `Acquire` → `Acquire`
-   `Release` → `Release`
-   `AcqRel` → `AcqRel`
-   `SeqCst` → `SequentiallyConsistent`

### Runtime Function Placeholders

The current implementation generates calls to runtime functions that would need to be provided by a concurrency runtime library:

-   `mutex_lock` / `mutex_unlock`
-   `condition_wait` / `condition_signal` / `condition_broadcast`

### Error Message Formatting

Error messages now include precise location information:

-   Line and column numbers for exact error location
-   Clear descriptions of the error type
-   Context-specific information (variable names, expected types, etc.)

## Next Steps

To fully utilize these features, the following work is needed:

1. **Runtime Library Implementation**: Create a runtime library that provides implementations of mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations for the target platform.

2. **Integration with Threading Systems**: Properly integrate with the target platform's threading system (e.g., pthreads on Unix-like systems, Windows API on Windows).

3. **Memory Management**: Implement proper memory management for concurrent data structures.

4. **Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling for concurrency-related operations.

5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the generated LLVM IR for better performance of concurrent programs.

6. **Transpilation Support**: Implement proper concurrency support in the JavaScript and Python transpilers.

7. **IDE Integration**: Integrate error location information with the IDE for real-time error highlighting.

## Testing

The unit tests can be run with:

```bash
cargo test
```

This will execute all tests, including the new concurrency feature tests and error handling tests.

## Conclusion

The KODEON compiler now supports advanced concurrency features including mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations, along with enhanced error handling that provides precise location information for better developer experience. These features provide developers with powerful tools for writing concurrent and parallel programs while maintaining the language's goal of natural-language-like syntax and excellent error reporting.
