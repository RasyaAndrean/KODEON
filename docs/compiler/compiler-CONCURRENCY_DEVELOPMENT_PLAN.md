# KODEON Concurrency Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing KODEON's concurrency features to fully support Go-style goroutines, channels, and synchronization primitives with proper LLVM backend integration.

## Current State

The KODEON compiler currently has:

-   Basic concurrency IR types (Channel, Goroutine, Mutex, Condition)
-   Partial implementation of concurrency instructions in IR
-   Examples showing intended syntax for concurrency features
-   Missing lexer/parser support for concurrency keywords
-   Incomplete LLVM backend translation for concurrency primitives

## Goals

1. Implement complete lexer/parser support for concurrency keywords
2. Enhance IR with full concurrency instruction set
3. Complete LLVM backend translation for concurrency features
4. Create comprehensive test suite for concurrency features
5. Document concurrency features with examples
