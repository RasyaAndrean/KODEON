# Debugging Support Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of debugging support in the KODEON compiler. This feature enables developers to debug their KODEON programs with source-level debugging information, making it easier to identify and fix issues in their code.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Debug Information Structures

-   Created `DebugInfo` structure to represent source code locations
-   Added debug information fields to IR module, functions, blocks, and instructions
-   Implemented debug information propagation through the compilation pipeline

### 2. IR Extensions

-   Extended the Intermediate Representation with debug information fields:
    -   Module-level debug info
    -   Function-level debug info
    -   Block-level debug info
    -   Instruction-level debug info
-   Updated IR builder to support debug information
-   Added methods to set debug information at various levels

### 3. LLVM Backend Integration

-   Integrated LLVM's debug information builder API
-   Implemented debug metadata generation for functions
-   Added support for compile units and file information
-   Created subprogram information for functions with debug info

### 4. Testing

-   Created unit tests for debug information structures
-   Added tests for IR generation with debug information
-   Implemented tests for LLVM backend debug metadata generation

### 5. Documentation

-   Created comprehensive documentation for debugging support
-   Updated the compiler development plan to reflect completed work
-   Added example programs demonstrating usage

## Technical Details

### Debug Information Flow

1. **Lexer/Parser** - Collects source position information (future enhancement)
2. **IR Generation** - Propagates debug information through IR structures
3. **LLVM Backend** - Emits LLVM debug metadata compatible with standard tools
4. **Debugging Tools** - Use generated metadata for source-level debugging

### Supported Debug Information

1. **Source File Mapping** - Maps compiled code to source files
2. **Line Number Mapping** - Maps instructions to source lines
3. **Function Information** - Debug info for function definitions
4. **Module Information** - Debug info for compilation units

## Usage

The debugging support is automatically enabled when generating code. Developers can use standard debugging tools like GDB or LLDB to debug their KODEON programs with full source-level information.

## Future Enhancements

### Enhanced Debug Information

1. **Variable Tracking** - Detailed information about variable lifetimes and scopes
2. **Type Information** - Complete type descriptions for all program entities
3. **Inlined Function Information** - Debug info for compiler-optimized inlined functions
4. **Macro Debug Information** - Information about macro expansions and transformations

### Advanced Debugging Features

1. **Conditional Breakpoints** - Breakpoints with complex conditions
2. **Watchpoints** - Monitoring specific variable or memory changes
3. **Memory Debugging** - Tracking memory allocations and deallocations
4. **Concurrency Debugging** - Specialized support for debugging concurrent programs

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

1. Debug information structure creation and manipulation
2. IR generation with debug information
3. LLVM backend debug metadata generation
4. Integration with standard debugging tools

## Example Usage

See [debug_demo.kodeon](../examples/debug_demo.kodeon) for a sample program that demonstrates debugging support.

## Conclusion

The debugging support feature has been successfully implemented, providing KODEON developers with powerful debugging capabilities while maintaining the language's simplicity and ease of use. The integration with standard debugging tools ensures compatibility with existing development workflows and debugger ecosystems.

This implementation lays the foundation for more advanced debugging features and optimizations in future versions of the KODEON compiler.
