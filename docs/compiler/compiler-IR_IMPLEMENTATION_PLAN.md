# Intermediate Representation (IR) Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the KODEON Intermediate Representation (IR), which serves as a bridge between the high-level KODEON language and the low-level target code generation.

## Current State

The current IR implementation in [ir.rs](src/ir.rs) provides basic intermediate representation capabilities including:
- Module, function, and basic block structures
- Core instruction set (binary operations, control flow, memory operations)
- Basic type system (int, float, bool, string, arrays, objects)
- Value and constant representations

## Goals

1. Enhance IR with comprehensive instruction set
2. Improve type system for advanced language features
3. Optimize IR for better code generation
4. Add support for concurrency and parallelism
5. Implement optimization passes
