# Markdown Files Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the reorganization of Markdown files in the KODEON project, where all Markdown files from subdirectories were moved to the centralized `docs` folder.

## Process

A PowerShell script was created and executed to move all Markdown files from the following directories to the `docs` folder:

-   community
-   compiler
-   ecosystem
-   examples
-   ide
-   research
-   scripts
-   stdlib
-   tests

## File Naming Convention

To avoid naming conflicts, all moved files were prefixed with their original directory path:

-   Original path: `compiler/docs/README.md`
-   New name: `compiler-docs-README.md`

## Results

-   **190 Markdown files** are now stored in the `docs` folder
-   **README.md** remains in the root directory as it should
-   All other Markdown files have been successfully relocated
-   No duplicate filenames exist due to the prefix naming convention

## Benefits

-   Centralized documentation for easier access
-   Eliminated scattered documentation files throughout the project
-   Improved project organization and maintainability
-   Simplified documentation management

## Verification

The reorganization was verified by:

1. Running the PowerShell script to move files
2. Confirming only README.md remains in the root directory
3. Counting the files in the docs folder (190 files)
4. Ensuring no duplicate filenames exist

This reorganization makes it easier to manage and access all documentation files in a single location.
