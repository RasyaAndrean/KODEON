## Advanced Technical Implementation

### 1. Type System Evolution

#### 1.1. Gradual Typing with Confidence

**Advanced Concept**: Combine static and dynamic typing with confidence levels.

```kodeon
// Example of confidence-based typing
var confident_number: int = 42  // 100% confidence
var uncertain_value = "42"      // 0% confidence (dynamic)
var guessed_type: int? = "42"   // 50% confidence (gradual)
```

#### 1.2. Dependent Types for Verification

**Advanced Concept**: Types that depend on values for enhanced correctness.

```kodeon
// Example of dependent types
fungsi create_array(size: int positif): Array[dengan_panjang size] {
    kembalikan buat_array(size)
}

// This would cause a compile-time error:
// var arr = create_array(-5)  // Error: -5 is not positive
```

### 2. Concurrency Model Enhancement

#### 2.1. Actor-Based Concurrency

**Advanced Concept**: Implement the actor model for safer concurrent programming.

```kodeon
aktor BankAccount {
    var balance: int = 0

    pesan deposit(amount: int) {
        balance = balance + amount
    }

    pesan withdraw(amount: int): bool {
        jika balance >= amount maka:
            balance = balance - amount
            kembalikan benar
        sebaliknya:
            kembalikan salah
    }

    pesan get_balance(): int {
        kembalikan balance
    }
}

fungsi utama() {
    var account = BankAccount.baru()
    account.deposit(100)
    var success = account.withdraw(50)
    var balance = account.get_balance()
    cetak("Saldo akhir: ", balance)
}
```

#### 2.2. Dataflow Programming Integration

**Advanced Concept**: Enable dataflow programming for reactive systems.

```kodeon
// Example of dataflow programming
aliran data_sensor = sumber_data("/dev/sensor")
aliran data_diproses = data_sensor
    .saring(x => x.valid)
    .petakan(x => x.nilai)
    .kurangi((akum, item) => akum + item, 0)

data_diproses.untuk_setiap(hasil => cetak("Rata-rata: ", hasil))
```

### 3. Memory Management Innovation

#### 3.1. Ownership with Intent

**Advanced Concept**: Extend ownership concepts with programmer intent.

```kodeon
// Example of intent-based ownership
fungsi process_data(data: &[int] baca_saja) {
    // Compiler ensures data is only read, not modified
    var sum = 0
    untuk item dalam data {
        sum = sum + item
    }
    kembalikan sum
}

fungsi modify_data(data: &mut [int] ubah) {
    // Compiler ensures data can be modified
    untuk i dalam 0..data.panjang() {
        data[i] = data[i] * 2
    }
}
```

#### 3.2. Garbage Collection with Guarantees

**Advanced Concept**: Hybrid memory management with explicit guarantees.

```kodeon
// Example of guaranteed memory management
sumber daya file = buka_file("data.txt") dengan_jaminan {
    otomatis_tutup_setelah 30.detik
    peringatan_sebelum_tutup 5.detik
}

// File is guaranteed to be closed with specified conditions
```
