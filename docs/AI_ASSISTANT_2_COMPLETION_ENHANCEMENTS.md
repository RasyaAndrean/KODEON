# AI Assistant 2.0 Code Completion Engine Enhancements

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Code Completion Engine for AI Assistant 2.0. These enhancements significantly improve the code completion capabilities of the KODEON IDE's AI assistant.

## Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Context Analysis

The Code Completion Engine now provides more sophisticated context analysis:

-   **Surrounding Context**: Analyzes 5 lines before and after the current line
-   **Scope Detection**: Determines the current scope (global, function, class)
-   **Function Context**: Extracts information about the current function context
-   **Class Context**: Extracts information about the current class context
-   **Project Context**: Maintains project-level context for more relevant suggestions

### 2. Advanced Keyword Recognition

Enhanced keyword extraction with support for specialized domains:

-   **Neural Network Keywords**: Recognizes neural network and machine learning keywords
-   **Quantum Computing Keywords**: Recognizes quantum computing keywords
-   **Traditional Keywords**: Maintains support for all existing KODEON keywords

### 3. Domain-Specific Suggestions

Added specialized suggestions for advanced domains:

-   **Neural Network Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for neural network constructs
-   **Quantum Computing Suggestions**: Provides suggestions for quantum computing constructs
-   **Traditional Suggestions**: Maintains all existing suggestion types

### 4. User and Project Personalization

Enhanced personalization capabilities:

-   **User Preferences**: Tracks and uses user preferences for personalized suggestions
-   **Project Context**: Maintains project-level context for relevant suggestions
-   **Usage History**: Tracks usage patterns to improve suggestions over time

### 5. Predictive Capabilities

Added predictive token generation:

-   **Context-Based Predictions**: Predicts next tokens based on current context
-   **Domain-Specific Predictions**: Provides domain-specific token predictions
-   **Scope-Aware Predictions**: Generates predictions based on current scope

## New Methods Added

### Context Management Methods

-   `updateUserPreferences(preferences)`: Updates user preferences
-   `updateProjectContext(context)`: Updates project context
-   `getUsageStatistics()`: Retrieves usage statistics

### Enhanced Analysis Methods

-   `analyzeSurroundingContext(lines, currentLineNumber)`: Analyzes surrounding context
-   `determineScope(code, lineNumber)`: Determines current scope
-   `extractFunctionContext(lines, currentLineNumber)`: Extracts function context
-   `extractClassContext(lines, currentLineNumber)`: Extracts class context

### Prediction Methods

-   `predictNextTokens(context)`: Predicts next tokens based on context

## Example Usage

### Neural Network Context

```
Input context: "jaringan myNetwork = ()"
Output: Suggestions for adding layers, training, and making predictions
```

### Quantum Computing Context

```
Input context: "kubit q0"
Output: Suggestions for applying gates and measuring qubits
```

### Function Context

```
Input context: "fungsi calculateSum(a, b):"
Output: Suggestions for return statements and function body constructs
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Improvements

-   **Modular Design**: Enhanced modularity for easier maintenance and extension
