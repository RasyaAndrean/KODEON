- AI/ML integration with wrappers for TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Game development kit with 2D/3D graphics APIs
- Automation & scripting capabilities for all platforms
- Embedded system readiness with C/C++ transpilation

### Phase 4: Evolution & Technology (v3.0) - 🔮 PLANNED

**Objective**: Make KODEON a modern language ready for the future.

#### Planned Features

- Native Virtual Machine (Kodeon VM) independent of Python
- JIT Compiler for improved performance
- Advanced concurrency and parallelism support
- Plugin system for community extensions
- WebAssembly target for browser execution
