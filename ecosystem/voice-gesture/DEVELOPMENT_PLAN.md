# Voice and Gesture Programming Interface Development Plan

## Overview

The Voice and Gesture module will enable KODEON developers to create applications controlled by voice commands and gesture recognition.

## Goals

1. Voice-controlled programming
2. Gesture-based interaction
3. Natural user interfaces
4. Accessibility improvements
5. Hands-free development

## Implementation Phases
