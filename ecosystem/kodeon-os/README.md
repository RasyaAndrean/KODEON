# KODEON-OS

KODEON-OS is a revolutionary operating system built entirely with the KODEON programming language. It represents the ultimate expression of KODEON's capabilities, demonstrating how the language can be used to build complex, low-level systems.

## Overview

KODEON-OS is designed to be a lightweight, secure, and highly customizable operating system that showcases the power of natural language programming at the system level. It includes:

-   Kernel written in KODEON
-   Device drivers using KODEON's hardware abstraction
-   System services and utilities
-   Package management integrated with KODEON's ecosystem
-   Security framework built on KODEON's security modules

## Features

### Natural Language System Calls

Unlike traditional operating systems that use cryptic system call numbers, KODEON-OS uses natural language commands:

```
// Request file access
minta_akses_berkas("myfile.txt", "baca_tulis")

// Allocate memory
alokasi_memori(4096 bytes)

// Create process
buat_proses("myapp.kodeon")
```

### Multi-language Support

KODEON-OS supports both English and Indonesian system calls:

```
// English
request_file_access("myfile.txt", "read_write")

// Indonesian
minta_akses_berkas("myfile.txt", "baca_tulis")
```

### Integrated Development Environment

KODEON-OS includes a built-in development environment that allows users to write, compile, and run KODEON programs directly from the system.

### Security by Design

Built with KODEON's security modules, KODEON-OS provides:

-   Sandboxed execution environments
-   Built-in encryption for all file operations
-   Permission-based access control using natural language
-   Secure boot process

## Architecture

### Kernel

The kernel is written entirely in KODEON and provides:

-   Process management
-   Memory management
-   File system interface
-   Device driver interface
-   Network stack
-   Security framework

### File System

KODEON-OS uses a custom file system called KFS (KODEON File System) that:

-   Supports natural language file attributes
-   Provides built-in encryption
-   Offers version control for files
-   Supports both hierarchical and tag-based organization

### Package Management

Integrated with KODEON's package manager, allowing:

-   Installation of system components
-   Updates through natural language commands
-   Dependency resolution
-   Security verification

## Development Status

This is a conceptual component of the KODEON ecosystem that demonstrates the language's potential for system-level programming. Implementation is planned for future phases of development.

## Getting Started

As this is a conceptual component, there are no current installation instructions. Please refer to the KODEON documentation for information about the language itself.
