# Getting Started with KODEON-OS

This document provides an overview of the conceptual KODEON-OS operating system and its planned features.

## Overview

KODEON-OS represents the future of operating system development using natural language programming. While currently conceptual, this document outlines the planned architecture and features.

## Planned Features

### Kernel Architecture

The KODEON-OS kernel will be written entirely in KODEON, featuring:

-   Microkernel design for modularity
-   Natural language system calls
-   Built-in security framework
-   Real-time processing capabilities

### System Services

Planned system services include:

-   File system manager
-   Process scheduler
-   Memory manager
-   Network stack
-   Device driver framework

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Conceptual Design

-   Complete system architecture specification
-   Define natural language API
-   Establish security model

### Phase 2: Prototype Development

-   Implement basic kernel functionality
-   Create initial system services
-   Develop boot process

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation

-   Add device driver support
-   Implement networking stack
-   Create user interface framework

## Contributing

As this is a conceptual component, contributions are focused on design and specification. Please see the main KODEON contributing guidelines for more information.
