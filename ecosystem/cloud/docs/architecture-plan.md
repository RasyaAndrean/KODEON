3. **Version Control Integration**: Built-in Git support for project management
4. **Cross-Platform Access**: Access projects from any device with a web browser
5. **Resource Scalability**: Leverage cloud resources for compilation and execution
6. **Project Templates**: Pre-built templates for common project types
7. **Extension Support**: Access to the KODEON marketplace extensions
8. **AI Assistant Integration**: Full AI-powered code assistance
9. **Deployment Tools**: One-click deployment to various hosting platforms

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

-   React.js for UI components
-   Redux for state management
-   Monaco Editor for code editing
-   Socket.IO for real-time communication
-   WebSockets for collaborative features

### Backend

-   Node.js with Express.js
-   MongoDB for document storage
-   Redis for caching
-   Docker for containerization
-   Kubernetes for orchestration

### Infrastructure

-   NGINX for reverse proxy
-   Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
-   Prometheus for monitoring
-   Grafana for visualization

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with multi-factor authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption for data at rest and in transit
4. **Code Sandboxing**: Secure execution environment for user code
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DDoS attacks
6. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring

## Performance Requirements

1. **Response Time**: IDE operations should respond within 200ms
2. **Compilation Time**: Code compilation should complete within 5 seconds for most projects
3. **Execution Time**: Code execution should start within 1 second
4. **Collaboration Latency**: Real-time collaboration updates within 100ms
5. **Scalability**: Support for 10,000 concurrent users

## Deployment Strategy

1. **Development**: Local development with Docker Compose
2. **Staging**: Kubernetes cluster with limited resources
3. **Production**: Multi-region Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
4. **CI/CD**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline
