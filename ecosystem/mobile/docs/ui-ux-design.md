# KODEON Mobile IDE - UI/UX Design

## Overview

The KODEON Mobile IDE is designed to provide a powerful yet intuitive coding experience on mobile devices. The interface needs to be optimized for touch interactions while maintaining the full functionality of the desktop IDE.

## Design Principles

1. **Touch-First Design**: All interactions should be optimized for touch screens
2. **Minimalist Interface**: Reduce clutter to maximize code editing space
3. **Contextual Actions**: Show relevant options based on current context
4. **Responsive Layout**: Adapt to different screen sizes and orientations
5. **Performance Focused**: Minimize resource usage for smooth operation
