# KODEON Mobile Development

This directory contains planning and implementation details for KODEON mobile development capabilities.

## Contents

- [MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - Implementation plan for mobile development features

## Overview

The KODEON mobile development initiative aims to enable developers to create mobile applications using the KODEON programming language. This includes:

- Native mobile app compilation
- Cross-platform mobile development
- Mobile-specific APIs and libraries
- Integration with mobile development tools
- Performance optimization for mobile devices

## Implementation Plan

See [MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](MOBILE_DEVELOPMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed implementation steps and roadmap.

## Target Platforms

- iOS
- Android
- Cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter compatibility)

## Features

- Native UI components
- Device API access (camera, GPS, sensors)
- Push notifications
- Offline storage
- Performance monitoring
- App store integration

## Development Approach

The mobile development implementation will follow these phases:

1. **Foundation** - Basic mobile app compilation
2. **Core Features** - Essential mobile APIs
3. **Advanced Features** - Performance optimization and advanced APIs
4. **Ecosystem** - Tools and libraries for mobile development
