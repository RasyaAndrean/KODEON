- URL parameter parsing

## Implementation Details

### Language Design

The framework fully embraces KODEON's philosophy of natural language programming:

```kodeon
// Creating an application
buat aplikasi = web.buat_aplikasi()

// Defining routes
aplikasi.dapatkan("/", fungsi(permintaan, respons):
    respons.kirim("Halo Dunia!")
)

// Starting the server
aplikasi.dengarkan(3000, fungsi():
    tampilkan("Server berjalan di port 3000")
)
```

### Component Integration

All components work together seamlessly:

1. **Application** orchestrates the entire framework
2. **Middleware** processes requests before routing
3. **Router** matches requests to appropriate handlers
4. **Handlers** process business logic
5. **Response** sends data back to clients

### Extensibility

The framework is designed to be easily extensible:

- Custom middleware can be added with `gunakan()`
- Custom routes can be defined with HTTP method functions
- Database models can be extended with class inheritance
- Template engines can be swapped out

## Examples Provided

### Hello World Application

A simple web server demonstrating basic routing and middleware usage.

### Todo App

A RESTful API demonstrating CRUD operations and data management.

## Testing Framework

- Unit tests for core components
- Integration tests for framework features
- Example test structure for application testing
- Assertion library for test validation

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

### Feature Enhancements

1. Implement full HTTP server integration with KODEON's runtime
2. Add more advanced template engine features
3. Implement comprehensive database adapter system
4. Add session management capabilities
5. Implement security middleware (CSRF, XSS protection)
6. Add WebSocket support for real-time communication

### Performance Optimization

1. Implement connection pooling for database operations
2. Add request caching mechanisms
3. Optimize template rendering performance
4. Implement async/await support for non-blocking operations

### Documentation Enhancement

1. Create comprehensive API reference
2. Develop tutorial series for common use cases
3. Add migration guides from other frameworks
4. Create deployment guides for various platforms

### Community Features
