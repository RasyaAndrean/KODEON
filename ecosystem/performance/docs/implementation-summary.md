The main [Performance](../src/performance.kodeon) class provides the primary interface:

```kodeon
kelas Performance {
    fungsi inisialisasi_monitoring(konfigurasi)
    fungsi mulai_profil()
    fungsi hentikan_profil()
    fungsi dapatkan_laporan()
    fungsi mulai_profil_memori()
    fungsi hentikan_profil_memori()
    fungsi dapatkan_laporan_memori()
}
```

### Component Classes

Each component has a well-defined API:

1. **Profiler**: Performance profiling and analysis
2. **Benchmark**: Benchmarking framework for performance testing
3. **Monitor**: Real-time performance monitoring
4. **Optimizer**: Performance optimization recommendations
5. **MemoryProfiler**: Memory profiling and analysis
6. **CPUProfiler**: CPU usage analysis
7. **IOProfiler**: I/O performance monitoring
8. **Reporter**: Performance reporting and visualization
9. **ProfilerKinerja**: Main performance profiling module
