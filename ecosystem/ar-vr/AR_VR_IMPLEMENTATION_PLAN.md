# AR/VR Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for KODEON AR/VR capabilities, enabling developers to create augmented and virtual reality applications using the familiar KODEON syntax and paradigms.

## Current State

AR/VR support is currently in the planning phase with:
- Development plan in [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)
- Conceptual architecture design
- Integration points with existing 3D libraries

## Goals

1. Enable AR/VR application development in KODEON
2. Provide intuitive 3D programming interface
3. Integrate with existing AR/VR ecosystems
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility
5. Maintain KODEON's simplicity and ease of use
