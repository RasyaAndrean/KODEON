# Brain-Computer Interface Integration Development Plan

## Overview

The BCI Integration module will enable KODEON developers to create applications that can be controlled directly by brain signals using brain-computer interface technology.

## Goals

1. Brain signal interpretation
2. Direct mental command execution
3. Neural feedback integration
4. Cognitive load monitoring
5. Revolutionary programming interface

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Framework

- BCI device integration
- Basic brain signal processing
- Simple mental command recognition
- Safety and calibration procedures

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

- Complex thought pattern recognition
- Emotional state detection
- Cognitive load measurement
- Adaptive interface based on mental state

### Phase 3: Production Features

- Hands-free programming
- Mental debugging assistance
- Neural-enhanced creativity tools
- Brain-to-code translation

## Technical Requirements

- Integration with BCI hardware (OpenBCI, Emotiv, etc.)
- Advanced signal processing
- Machine learning for pattern recognition
- Safety and privacy protection

## Dependencies

- Working KODEON compiler
- AI assistant module
- Voice and gesture interface
