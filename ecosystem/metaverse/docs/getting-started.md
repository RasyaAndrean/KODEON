# Getting Started with Metaverse Development

This document provides an overview of the conceptual Metaverse Development Framework for KODEON.

## Overview

The Metaverse Development Framework extends KODEON's capabilities to support immersive 3D experiences and virtual worlds.

## Planned Features

### 3D Graphics Engine

Natural language interface to 3D graphics:

-   Scene creation and management
-   Object manipulation and animation
-   Material and lighting systems
-   Physics simulation

### Networking

Multi-user virtual environments:

-   Real-time synchronization
-   User presence tracking
-   Distributed computing support
-   Security and privacy controls

### User Interface

Immersive UI components:

-   3D widgets and controls
-   Spatial menus and navigation
-   Gesture recognition
-   Voice commands

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Conceptual Design

-   Complete framework architecture specification
-   Define natural language 3D APIs
-   Establish rendering pipeline

### Phase 2: Prototype Development

-   Implement basic 3D rendering
-   Create initial physics system
-   Develop networking foundation

### Phase 3: Feature Implementation

-   Add advanced graphics features
-   Implement full physics engine
-   Create comprehensive UI system

## Contributing
