## üéØ Design Principles

### Natural Language Programming

All APIs follow KODEON's natural language philosophy, providing intuitive method names in both Indonesian and English:

```kodeon
// Indonesian
rt.inisialisasi_runtime()
rt.jalankan_aplikasi()
rt.pantau_kinerja()

// English equivalent would be available as well
```

### Component-Based Architecture

The system uses a component-based design where each functionality is encapsulated in reusable modules:

-   Clear separation of concerns
-   Easy extensibility
-   Modular design
-   Consistent API patterns

### Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling with meaningful error messages:

```kodeon
jika bukan ini.terhubung {
    tampilkan("Kesalahan: Komponen belum diinisialisasi")
    kembalikan salah
}
```

### Performance Considerations

The implementation follows performance best practices:

-   Efficient resource usage
-   Lazy initialization
-   Memory optimization
-   Asynchronous operations where appropriate

## üîß Implementation Details
