### Main Security Class

The main [Security](../src/security.kodeon) class provides the primary interface:

```kodeon
kelas Security {
    fungsi inisialisasi_keamanan(konfigurasi)
    fungsi tambah_pengguna(email, password)
    fungsi otentikasi(email, password)
    fungsi otorisasi(pengguna, izin)
    fungsi enkripsi(data, kunci)
    fungsi dekripsi(data, kunci)
}
```

### Component Classes

Each component has a well-defined API:

1. **Otentikasi**: User authentication management
2. **Otorisasi**: Access control and permissions
3. **Enkripsi**: Data encryption and decryption
4. **Audit**: Security event logging and monitoring
5. **Hashing**: Secure hashing functions
6. **Signature**: Digital signature utilities
7. **Validator**: Input validation and sanitization
8. **Scanner**: Security vulnerability scanning
9. **PasswordAuth**: Password-based authentication
10. **BiometricAuth**: Biometric authentication
11. **OAuth**: OAuth integration
12. **SymmetricEncryption**: Symmetric encryption algorithms
13. **AsymmetricEncryption**: Asymmetric encryption algorithms
