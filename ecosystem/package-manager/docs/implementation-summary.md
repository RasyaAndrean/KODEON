# KODEON Package Manager Implementation Summary

This document provides a technical overview of the KODEON Package Manager implementation.

## Architecture Overview

The KODEON Package Manager follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### Core Module

-   `IntiPackageManager`: The core package manager functionality that orchestrates all operations

### Components

-   `Paket`: Package representation and management
-   `Registry`: Package registry for package discovery
-   `Resolver`: Dependency resolver for package dependencies
-   `Installer`: Package installer for installing packages

### Utilities

-   `Cache`: Package caching mechanisms
-   `Keamanan`: Security verification features
-   `Versi`: Version management and comparison
-   `Downloader`: Package downloading functionality

### CLI

-   `CommandLine`: Command-line interface for package management

## Key Features Implementation

### Package Management

The package management system supports:

-   Installing packages from local and remote sources
-   Removing packages from projects
-   Updating packages to newer versions
-   Listing installed packages
-   Searching for packages in the registry

Implementation is in [src/core/package-manager-core.kodeon](../src/core/package-manager-core.kodeon)

### Dependency Resolution

The dependency resolver:

-   Parses package dependencies
-   Resolves version conflicts
-   Builds dependency trees
-   Validates resolution results

Implementation is in [src/components/resolver.kodeon](../src/components/resolver.kodeon)

### Package Installation

The installer component:

-   Downloads packages from remote sources
-   Extracts package contents
-   Places files in the correct locations
-   Handles installation progress and errors

Implementation is in [src/components/installer.kodeon](../src/components/installer.kodeon)

### Package Registry

The registry component:

-   Connects to remote package registries
-   Searches for packages
-   Retrieves package information
-   Publishes packages to the registry

Implementation is in [src/components/registry.kodeon](../src/components/registry.kodeon)

### Security Verification

The security component:

-   Verifies package integrity using hashes
-   Validates package signatures
-   Manages trusted certificates
-   Blocks malicious packages

Implementation is in [src/utils/security.kodeon](../src/utils/security.kodeon)

### Version Management

The version component:

-   Parses semantic version strings
-   Compares versions
-   Validates version constraints
-   Handles version incrementing

Implementation is in [src/utils/version.kodeon](../src/utils/version.kodeon)

### Caching

The cache component:

-   Stores downloaded packages and metadata
-   Manages cache size and eviction
-   Improves performance by avoiding redundant downloads
-   Handles cache validation

Implementation is in [src/utils/cache.kodeon](../src/utils/cache.kodeon)

### Downloading

The downloader component:

-   Manages download queues
-   Handles download progress
-   Manages download speed
-   Handles download failures and retries

Implementation is in [src/utils/downloader.kodeon](../src/utils/downloader.kodeon)

### Command Line Interface

The CLI component:

-   Parses command line arguments
-   Executes package management commands
-   Provides help and documentation
-   Maintains command history

Implementation is in [src/cli/command-line.kodeon](../src/cli/command-line.kodeon)

## API Design

The package manager API follows KODEON's natural language programming principles with dual language support (Indonesian and English):

### Main Package Manager Class

The main [PackageManager](../src/package-manager.kodeon) class provides the primary interface:

```kodeon
kelas PackageManager {
    fungsi inisialisasi_lingkungan(konfigurasi)
    fungsi pasang_paket(nama, versi)
    fungsi hapus_paket(nama)
    fungsi perbarui_paket(nama, versi)
    fungsi cari_paket(kueri)
    fungsi info_paket(nama)
    fungsi daftar_paket()
    fungsi periksa_pembaruan()
    fungsi publikasikan_paket(paket)
    fungsi verifikasi_paket(nama)
}
```

### Component Classes

Each component has a well-defined API:

1. **Paket**: Package representation and management
2. **Registry**: Package registry operations
3. **Resolver**: Dependency resolution
4. **Installer**: Package installation
5. **Cache**: Caching operations
6. **Keamanan**: Security verification
7. **Versi**: Version management
8. **Downloader**: Package downloading
9. **CommandLine**: CLI operations

## Integration with KODEON Ecosystem

The package manager integrates with other KODEON components:

### Compiler Integration

The package manager works with the KODEON compiler to:

-   Resolve import statements
-   Locate package files
-   Provide package metadata to the compiler

### Standard Library Integration

The package manager can manage standard library extensions and:

-   Install additional standard library modules
-   Update standard library components
-   Manage standard library versions

### IDE Integration

The package manager integrates with the KODEON IDE to:

-   Provide package autocomplete
-   Show package documentation
-   Enable package management through the UI

## Performance Considerations
