# üó∫Ô∏è KODEON Master Roadmap - Manifesto-Driven Development

## Vision

To create the world's most accessible, sustainable, and collaborative programming language that empowers everyone to code, regardless of their background, experience, or location.

## Guiding Philosophy

This roadmap is built upon the üåå Manifesto Kodeon principles:

1. **Simplicity First** - "Code should be read like a story, not like a puzzle."
2. **Universal Language for All Roles** - "One language, many worlds."
3. **Accessibility for Everyone** - "Coding should not be limited by borders."
4. **Elegance over Complexity** - "Beauty in clarity."
5. **Future-Oriented** - "A language built for today, ready for tomorrow."
6. **Community Power** - "A language is alive when the community speaks it."
7. **Human-Centered** - "Technology should serve people, not the other way around."
8. **Learning by Doing** - "The best way to learn coding is by creating."
9. **Sustainability in Code** - "Code that lasts is code that matters."
10. **Freedom & Responsibility** - "With great power comes great responsibility."
11. **Creativity First** - "Programming is an art as much as it is a science."
12. **Evolution, Not Revolution** - "Languages grow, not explode."
13. **Minimalism with Power** - "Less is more, if done right."
14. **Transparency in Design** - "A good language hides nothing."
15. **Borderless Collaboration** - "Code unites where politics divides."
