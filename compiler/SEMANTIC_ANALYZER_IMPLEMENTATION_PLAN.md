# Semantic Analyzer Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the KODEON semantic analyzer, which is responsible for checking the semantic correctness of the parsed code, including type checking, scope resolution, and symbol table management.

## Current State

The current semantic analyzer implementation in [semantic_analyzer.rs](src/semantic_analyzer.rs) provides basic semantic analysis capabilities including:
- Symbol table management
- Basic type checking
- Scope resolution
- Variable declaration and usage checking

## Goals

1. Enhance semantic analysis with comprehensive type checking
2. Implement advanced scope and lifetime analysis
3. Add support for object-oriented features
4. Improve error reporting and suggestions
5. Optimize analysis performance
