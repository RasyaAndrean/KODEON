## Technical Details

### Optimization Pass Architecture

1. **Trait-Based Design** - Uses `OptimizationPass` trait for extensibility
2. **Modular Implementation** - Each optimization pass is implemented as a separate struct
3. **Orchestrator Pattern** - `Optimizer` struct coordinates multiple passes
4. **IR Transformation** - Passes modify the IR in-place for efficiency

### Constant Folding Implementation

The constant folding pass analyzes binary and unary operations:

```rust
// For binary operations with constant operands
Instruction::BinaryOp { op, left, right, .. } => {
    if let (Value::Constant(left_const), Value::Constant(right_const)) = (left, right) {
        // Evaluate the operation based on operator and operand types
        // Return the computed constant value
    }
}
```

Supported operations:

-   Integer: Add, Sub, Mul, Div
-   Float: Add, Sub, Mul, Div
-   Boolean: And, Or
-   Unary: Not, Neg

### Dead Code Elimination Implementation

The dead code elimination pass identifies and removes unused instructions:

```rust
// Simplified implementation
block.instructions.retain(|instruction| {
    match instruction {
        // Keep instructions with side effects
        Instruction::Store { .. } => true,
        Instruction::Call { .. } => true,
        Instruction::Return { .. } => true,
        // Remove unused computations (simplified)
        _ => true,
    }
});
```

### Integration with Compilation Pipeline

The optimization passes are integrated into the main compilation flow:

1. **Parse Source Code** → Generate AST
2. **Semantic Analysis** → Validate program correctness
3. **IR Generation** → Create unoptimized IR
4. **Optimization** → Apply optimization passes
5. **Code Generation** → Generate target code

## Usage

The optimization passes are automatically applied during compilation. Developers can use the `--verbose` flag to see which optimization passes are being applied:

```bash
# Compile with optimizations (default)
kompiler program.kodeon

# Compile with verbose output to see optimization passes
kompiler program.kodeon --verbose
```

## Performance Benefits

### Constant Folding

-   **Runtime Reduction** - Eliminates computations that can be done at compile time
-   **Code Size Reduction** - Replaces expressions with their computed values
-   **Example**: `2 + 3 * 4` becomes `14` in the compiled code

### Dead Code Elimination

-   **Memory Usage Reduction** - Removes unused variable allocations
-   **Execution Speed Improvement** - Eliminates unnecessary computations
-   **Cache Performance** - Smaller code size leads to better cache utilization

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Optimization Passes

1. **Function Inlining** - Replace function calls with function bodies for small functions
2. **Loop Optimizations** - Loop unrolling, invariant code motion, strength reduction
3. **Register Allocation** - Efficient use of CPU registers for variables
4. **Global Value Numbering** - Eliminate redundant computations across basic blocks

### LLVM Integration

1. **Pass Manager Integration** - Use LLVM's pass manager for advanced optimizations
2. **Target-Specific Optimizations** - Leverage LLVM's target-specific passes
3. **Profile-Guided Optimization** - Use profiling data to guide optimizations
4. **Link-Time Optimization** - Optimize across compilation units

### Performance Analysis

1. **Profiling Instrumentation** - Add instrumentation to measure program performance
2. **Benchmarking Framework** - Measure optimization effectiveness
3. **Visualization Tools** - Graphical representation of performance improvements
4. **Automatic Tuning** - Adjust optimizations based on program characteristics

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests covering:

1. **Constant Folding Operations** - Verify correct evaluation of constant expressions
2. **Dead Code Elimination** - Test removal of unused code
3. **Optimization Framework** - Verify pass execution and coordination
4. **Integration Testing** - Test complete optimization pipeline
5. **Performance Benchmarking** - Measure optimization effectiveness
