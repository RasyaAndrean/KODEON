# KODEON Compiler Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for the KODEON compiler, including current status, upcoming features, and implementation roadmap.

## Current Status

The KODEON compiler is in active development with the following components implemented:

1. **Lexer** - Tokenizes KODEON source code with position tracking
2. **Parser** - Generates AST from tokens with enhanced error reporting
3. **Semantic Analyzer** - Performs type checking and symbol resolution with detailed error messages
4. **Intermediate Representation (IR)** - Platform-independent representation
5. **LLVM Backend** - Compiles IR to LLVM IR for high-performance execution
6. **Transpilers** - JavaScript and Python code generation
7. **Standard Library Integration** - Module system for importing standard library functions
8. **Debugging Support** - Debug information generation for source-level debugging
9. **Optimization Passes** - Compiler optimizations for better performance
