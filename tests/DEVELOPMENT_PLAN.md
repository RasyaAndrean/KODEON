# KODEON Testing Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for KODEON testing, organized according to the [MASTER_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md](../MASTER_ORGANIZATION_PLAN.md). The testing framework includes unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, performance tests, and compatibility tests.

## Current Status

The KODEON testing framework includes:

1. **Unit Tests** - Rust-based tests for individual compiler components in [unit/](unit/)
2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end tests for the complete compilation pipeline in [integration/](integration/)
3. **Functional Tests** - KODEON programs used for feature testing in [functional/](functional/)
4. **Performance Tests** - Tests for performance characteristics in [performance/](performance/)
5. **Compatibility Tests** - Tests for cross-platform compatibility in [compatibility/](compatibility/)

## Testing Framework

### Unit Testing Framework

-   Rust's built-in testing framework
-   Custom assertions for compiler components
-   Mock objects for dependencies
-   Test data generators
-   Code coverage measurement

### Integration Testing Framework

-   End-to-end test runner
-   Test environment management
-   Result validation tools
-   Performance measurement
-   Reporting system

### Functional Testing Framework

-   Feature-specific test suites
-   Cross-language test validation
-   Error condition testing
-   Boundary condition testing
-   Regression testing

## Test Standards

### Code Quality

-   Tests should be clear and maintainable
-   Each test should verify a single behavior
-   Tests should include documentation
-   Test code should follow the same standards as production code

### Coverage

-   Target 90%+ code coverage
-   Test both positive and negative cases
-   Test edge cases and boundary conditions
-   Test error handling paths
-   Test multi-language features

### Performance

-   Tests should run efficiently
-   Avoid unnecessary setup/teardown
-   Use appropriate test data sizes
-   Monitor test execution time
-   Identify and fix performance bottlenecks

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline

-   Automated test execution on code changes
-   Multiple platform testing
-   Code coverage reporting
-   Performance regression detection
-   Security scanning

### Quality Gates

-   All tests must pass
