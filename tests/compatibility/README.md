# KODEON Compatibility Tests

This directory contains tests for compatibility across platforms, versions, and environments.

## Purpose

Compatibility tests verify that KODEON works correctly across:

1. Different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Different LLVM versions
3. Different target platforms (x86, ARM, etc.)
4. Different runtime environments

## Test Structure

Compatibility tests are organized by:

1. **Platform Compatibility** - Testing on different operating systems
2. **Version Compatibility** - Testing with different versions of dependencies
3. **Environment Compatibility** - Testing in different runtime environments

## Running Compatibility Tests

Compatibility tests are typically run in CI/CD environments that provide multiple platforms and configurations.

To run compatibility tests locally:

```bash
# This will depend on your specific environment setup
cd compiler
cargo test --all-features
```

## Contributing

When adding new compatibility tests:

1. Place test files in appropriate subdirectories
2. Document which platforms/versions the tests target
3. Ensure tests are well-documented with expected behaviors
4. Verify tests work across multiple environments before submitting changes

For more information about the testing roadmap, see [../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](../DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).
