# ðŸŒŒ Manifesto-Driven Advanced Development for KODEON

## Vision Alignment

This document outlines how the advanced features development for KODEON aligns with and reinforces the core manifesto principles that guide the language's evolution. Every technical decision and implementation approach is evaluated against these fundamental values to ensure we're building not just a better programming language, but one that truly serves its community and purpose.

## Manifesto Principles and Advanced Feature Alignment

### 1. Simplicity First - "Code should read like a story, not like a puzzle."

#### Advanced Implementation Approach

The confidence typing system exemplifies this principle by making type information intuitive:

-   Developers express their certainty level naturally (`?high`, `?medium`, `?low`)
-   The system adapts to provide appropriate assistance based on confidence
-   Complex type theory is hidden behind simple, narrative-like syntax

#### Technical Manifestation

```kodeon
// Simple declaration with full confidence
var age: int = 25

// Partial confidence with natural expression
var uncertain_value: int?medium = getUserInput()

// Dynamic with zero confidence
var dynamic_value = complexCalculation()
```

#### Alignment Evidence

-   **Readability**: Code reads like natural language about confidence levels
-   **Intuitiveness**: Developers can express their intent without complex syntax
-   **Adaptability**: System responds to developer confidence rather than imposing rigidity

### 2. Universal Language for All Roles - "One language, many worlds."

#### Advanced Implementation Approach

The actor model bridges different programming paradigms:

-   Systems programmers can use low-level control features
-   Application developers benefit from high-level abstractions
-   Distributed systems engineers leverage built-in concurrency
-   Data scientists utilize stream processing capabilities

#### Technical Manifestation

```kodeon
// Systems programmer approach with fine control
aktor FileSystemManager {
    var file_handles: Map[string, FileHandle]

    pesan open_file(path: string) dengan_kontrol {
        var handle = sistem.buka_file(path) dengan_izin(BACA_TULIS)
        file_handles[path] = handle
    }
}

// Application developer approach with simplicity
aktor NotificationService {
    pesan send_email(to: string, subject: string, body: string) {
        email_kirim(to, subject, body)
    }
}
```

#### Alignment Evidence

-   Developers express purpose rather than mechanics
-   The system infers appropriate behavior from intent

#### Technical Manifestation

```kodeon
// Elegant expression of intent
fungsi proses_data(data: &[int] baca_saja) {
    // Compiler ensures data is only read
    var sum = data.lipat(0, (akum, item) => akum + item)
    kembalikan sum
}

fungsi ubah_data(data: &mut [int] ubah_sementara) {
    // Compiler ensures temporary modifications
    untuk i dalam 0..data.panjang() {
        data[i] = transformasi(data[i])
    }
    // Automatic cleanup of temporary changes
}
```
